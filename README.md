# Travel Journal Project
The travel journal project is a static website built using the front-end JavaScript library, React. The travel journal displays various travel destinations and I have visited in the past. Each destination displays a photo, the location city and country, a link to the location's Google Maps URL, travel dates, and a description with fun facts about the destination.
